Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR), is a computer vision technique used to identify and extract license plate information from vehicles. It combines image processing and machine learning to automate vehicle identification, commonly used in areas like traffic management, toll booths, and law enforcement.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the system typically works:

Image Capture: Cameras capture images or video frames of vehicles. These can come from traffic cameras, surveillance cameras, or mobile devices.

Preprocessing: The captured image goes through preprocessing steps to enhance quality. This includes removing noise, adjusting brightness, and improving contrast for better detection of the number plate.

License Plate Localization: Using image processing techniques, the system identifies the region of interest where the license plate is located. Methods like edge detection, contour finding, or machine learning models help pinpoint this area.

Character Segmentation: After locating the plate, the characters (letters and numbers) are segmented, which means dividing the image into individual components to isolate each character.

Character Recognition (OCR): Optical Character Recognition (OCR) algorithms are then applied to identify and convert the segmented characters into readable text. Machine learning models can be trained for this to improve accuracy.

Post-Processing: The recognized text is validated or refined, checking for errors or adjusting based on predefined rules like license plate formats in a specific region.

Application: The extracted plate number can be used for various purposes, such as tracking vehicles, issuing tickets, logging entries and exits in parking lots, or toll payments.
